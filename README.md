# <h1>Milestone-1-Online-Resume</h1>

This website is my first Milestone project on the [Code Institute - Full Stack Development Course](https://codeinstitute.net/)

## <h2>UX</h2>
As my audience for this website consists of potential employers and collaborators, I wanted to keep the website simple and professional. 
One of my main goals for the user experience was to create an intuitive, enjoyable experience whilst browsing my site to re-inforce my skills of web design to potential employers.
I also ensured my code was well commented to indicate to potential collaborators that I am well organised and collaborating with me would be an easy process. 

Having a fixed Nav bar at the top of the page means that potential employers would find navigating the site very easy. 
This is re-inforced by buttons linking to other pages within my website to learn more and to return to other pages on the website. 

Including the option to download my cv through a button is perfect for potential employers to quickly understand what experience I have and to gain and overview of my skills.

### <h3>User Story</h3>
As a potential employer I want a quick overview of this developer and what they are capable of.
I want to understand a bit about who they are as a person and their goals but also ensure that I'm in safe hands with my website / application. 

I'd like a lot of the main information to be structured on the main / landing page so I can get a summary and links to read more about relevant information.
I want the site to be structured in a logical manner such that I have a general path to go down to reach my end goal of contacting and employing this developer.

## <h2>Features</h2>

### <h3>Existing Features</h3>
Feature 1 - Fixed nav bar. This helps to make the site easy to navigate and adds a professional look to the site. 

Feature 2 - Large full page background image on landing page. This draws users in and makes the site look professional.

Feature 3 - Fade in animation adds smoothness to landing on each page. I have used inspiration for this animation from: 

Feature 4 - Buttons organised to display near relevant information to learn more or to provide additional navigational aid. 

Feature 5 - Animations added to buttons when they're hovered over to clearly show that the button is selectable. 

Feature 6 - Carousel Icon section - Courtesy of the Boostrap framework. This is a nice feature to draw a user in and demostrates my design skills. 

Feature 7 - Quote section at the bottom of each page. This adds my own twist to the website and gets the user thinking. This feature could help to ensure my site is memorable to 
            potential employers or collaborators.

Feature 8 - Dark Footer to provide contrast to the page to indicate the end of the page. 

Feature 9 - Icons placed inside sections to organise information and provide greater context to the section as a whole.

             Buttons linking to about me page and my cv offers more information. 

Feature 11 - A brief look at my work section provides and overview of my main completed projects (the completed projects shown in this section are not my own ideas and all rights
            go to code Institute)

Feature 12 - About me page summary. This builds on the information on the landing page summary. 

Feature 13 - My Skills section. This section gives an overview of my skill set for potential employers and collaborators.

Feature 14 - Work History section. This section gives an overview of my work History.

Feature 15 - Portfolio Page. This is a good place to showcase my completed projects to show to employers and collaborators. (the completed projects shown in this section are 
            not my own ideas and all rights go to code Institute)

Feature 16 - Contact me page. This provides my contact details and also a form which sends me an email. (the form is yet to be setup in the back end - see more about this 
             below.)

### <h3>Future planned Features / Features left to impliment</h3>
Feature 1 - I need to setup the back end of the contact me form once I have the knowledge to do so. 

Feature 2 - Add more projects to the Portfolio page as my portfolio grows. 

Feature 3 - I plan on changing the profile image to a more professional image. 

### <h3>Another feature idea</h3>
I plan on improving this page with javascript animations. 

## <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
This project was developed with HTML5 CSS3 and the Boostrap framework. 

### <h3>HTML5</h3>
[HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/) provides the semantic markup for the page. This includes Boostrap classes and my own classes and ID's which are linked to my CSS3 style sheet. 

### <h3>CSS3</h3>
[CCS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) provides the styles of the page and is referred to in the head of each HTML page. CSS is responsible for making the site responsive and arranging conent. 

### <h3>Boostrap Framework</h3>
[Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a Framework of HTML5, CSS3 and javascript which aids in the creation of websites because of the time it cuts on laying out and making the site responsive.

### <h3>Github, Gitpod and Github Pages</h3>
I use [Github](https://github.com/) for the storing of my repository which I use to store and edit my code. 
[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is linked to my github repository and I use it to edit and test my code in the browser. 
I use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy my finished project for users to view through a Web browser. 

I use the arsenal that Github provides to provide version control for my project, allow the option for collaboration and to test my code. 

### <h3>Font awesome icons</h3>
I used [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)'s icons on my page to break up the content and group related data.

### <h3>Google Fonts</h3>
I used [Google-fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts on my page. 

### <h3>Icons8.com</h3>
I used [icons-8.com](https://icons8.com/) for 2 of the icons on my page to break content up and group related data. 

### <h3/>Just In Mine Prototyper</h3>
I used [Just In Mine Prototyper](https://www.justinmind.com/) to build my wireframes so I had a basic overview of what I wanted my site to look like. 

## <h2>Testing</h2>
I test my code by running the server for my repository and viewing it in browser and using Chrome Developer tools to see what the site looks like on each screen size and to
edit the code in the browser. 

I ensure all sections are responsive and organised appealingly on all screen sizes. 

## <h2>Deployment</h2>
The process I have taken to deploy this project once it was completed are: 
1. Open the repository on GitHub
2. Go to "Settings" (the tab on the right)
3. Under the section "GitHub Pages", select the master branch as the source.  Then it shows you a green confirmation "Your site is published at......" with the URL.
When done share the url with me

There are no differences between my deployed code and the repository.

# <h1>Credits</h1>
## <h2>Content</h2>
My work section and Portfolio section - the projects on this page are for demonstration purposes only and all rights go to [Code-Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

I adapted the css code from [Tremaine Eto](https://medium.com/cloud-native-the-gathering/how-to-use-css-to-fade-in-and-fade-out-html-text-and-pictures-f45c11364f08)
to add the fade in animation to the body of each page on my site. 

The quotes on my site are all linked to pages about the quotes owner. All rights to these quotes go to their respective owners. 

I used Boostrap as a external dependency to speed up the development process.

I used [https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/timeline-events#css](https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/timeline-events#css)'s code snippet to build the work history section
and I have added my own styles and content to this.
